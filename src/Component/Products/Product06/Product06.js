                    <p>The inverter compressor can operate at variable speeds because it is operated with Inverter Drive Unlike the standard single
                    speed compressor, which is either off or operating at full speed (typically about 3 600 rpm), the digital inverter compressor is
                    almost always on, but can operate at different speeds Using the inverter, refrigerator drive from 1 100 to 4 300 rpm The digital
                    inverter compressor is one of the most important innovations in the history of refrigerators and food preservation</p>

                            <li>Brushless DC motors are often used in fan applications due to their easy speed controllability, high

                            <li>These motors are electronically commutated the commutation point is determined by Hall
                                sensors or sensor less (mainly by the so called back EMF method) In case of constant
                                commutation angle, this angle can be optimized only for one operating point</li>
                                <li>Through this optimization, motor current and power consumption can be reduced However, if the
                                motor works in another operating point (different supply voltage, speed and/or torque), its
                                efficiency will be lower than that of a motor with a commutation angle optimized for this new
